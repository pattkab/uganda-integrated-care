# Uganda Integrated Care Hub (GitHub Pages)

A simple, static website for health workers in Uganda: one place to read/download official resources for integrating HIV and chronic care into mainstream OPD.

## Deploy

1. Create a new **public** GitHub repository (e.g. `uganda-integrated-care`).
2. Upload all files from this ZIP (keep the `docs/` folder intact).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** → set **Deploy from branch** (main, root).
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/uganda-integrated-care/`.

## Add/Update PDFs

- Put additional PDFs in `/docs` and link them from `index.html` or extend `assets/app.js`.
- Filenames are already web-safe; you can add new ones by following the same pattern.

## Customization

- Edit `index.html` for content/sections.
- Adjust look & feel in `assets/style.css`.
- Extend search and cards in `assets/app.js`.
